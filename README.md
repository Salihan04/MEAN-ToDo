# ME_N-ToDo
A ToDo list single page application using the ME_N (Mongo, Express, any front end framework/library, Node) stack. I want to try to implement this app in a way that it is flexible to change the front end. I'll try out Vue.js, React.js and Angular.js fo rthe front end. This project is just to allow me apply the knowledge I have about the ME_N stack. Additionally, I want to explore writing unit tests and linking an app to a CI server.

## Objectives
* [ ] Display simple web page with title and heading
* [ ] Add form for input
* [ ] Add todo item
* [ ] Edit todo item
* [ ] Delete todo item
